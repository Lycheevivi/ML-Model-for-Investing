# ML-Model-for-Investing

Aim to build an algorithm to pick stocks that are predicted to outperform the market based on their fundamentals using the LightGBM model. Our model has innovatively incorporated Altman Z-score and Piotroski F-score into consideration on top of other traditional fundamental measures. The backtesting shows that our algorithm beat the market 75% of the time and has achieved a cumulative return more than double of the market return in the testing period, while maintaining a slightly higher Sharpe ratio to that of the market.
